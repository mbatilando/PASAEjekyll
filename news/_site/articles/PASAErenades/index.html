Although Valentines Day is a long ways ahead, love is still very much in the air! PASAE would like reach out and get your song ideas for us to perform during our annual PASAErenades fundraiser!
We will be accepting song requests up until Saturday, January 12th, 2013. If you would like us to perform a song that did not make it on the list, it will be $3 extra, so get your requests in now! 
Make a song request or sign up to be a performer!!<br /> <img src="../../images/newsimages/2012-2013/pasaeranades12-13.jpg" alt="PASAErenade!" width="300"/>
<a  href="http://tinyurl.com/pasaerenades2013"><b>Buy a PASAErenade!</b></a><br />
If you can sing or play an instrument, we highly encourage you to apply to be a performer! No need to bottle up talent! We're always in need of more performers (especially guy singers), 
so please apply by checking the appropriate boxes below and filling out your contact info (gmail/phone #).<br/>

For those of you who don't know what PASAErenades is, it's a 2-week long fundraising event held by PASAE. We have performers serenade your special someone at a given time and location in the 
Berkeley area. If your special someone lives outside the Berkeley area, we can record a PASAErenade for you or we can perform it over Skype. The event will begin on February 1st, 2013 and end 
on February 13th, 2013. We don't do requests for February 14th, because our performers will probably have their own Valentine's Day plans. Prices will start at $7, and the prices will increase 
each day as we get closer to Valentine's Day. PASAErenade requests are made online through a Google form. We ask that requests be made 2 days in advance, so our performers have time to prepare.
OTHERWISE, there is a late charge fee!<br />

More updates will come soon! Stay tuned! Thank you!
